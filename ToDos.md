# Entend this solution with other tools like Pulumi, Ansible, Crossplane etc., which is present inside the `tbd` folder.

# We have used `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` but can extend to using the following kubernetes resources:

    # - MutatingWebhookConfiguration
    # - OPA Gatekeeper with CRDs i.e., using ConstraintTemplate and Constraint
    # - AuditWebhookConfiguration
    # - OPA Sidecar or Init Container: Instead of using a sidecar, we can use an init container to inject the OPA policy into the pod.
    # - NetworkPolicy with OPA
    # - Resource Quotas and Limits
    # - OPA as an External Authorization Service 
    # - Integrate OPA with Kubernetes audit and monitoring tools like Prometheus or Falco to provide policy-based monitoring and alerting
